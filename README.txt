*FOODEE app is an application which help restaurants either large or small to optimise and have complete control over their business and customers.This application helps the restaurants to do all functionalities more accurately and faster way. It reduces the manual works and improves the efficiency of restaurants. This application helps in maintaining both the stock and cash flows.It also helps in maintaining day to day records in the system.

*The Web Ordering System
Users of the web ordering system, namely restaurant customers, must be provided the following functionality:
Create an account.
Manage their account.
Navigate menus.
Select an item from the menu.
Add an item to their current order.
Review their current order.
Provide delivery and payment details.
Place an order.
Receive confirmation in the form of an order number.
Receive confirmation of payment.
	             
                 
As the goal of the system is to make the process of placing an order as simple as possible for the customer.All of the functions outlined above, without the exceptions of account creation and management, will be used every time a customer places an order.

*Menu Management System
	The menu management system will be available only to restaurant employees and will, as the name suggests, allow them to manage the menu that is displayed to users of the web ordering system. The functions afforded by the menu management system provide admin with the ability to, using a graphical interface:
Add a new/update/delete vendor to/from the menu.
Add a new/update/delete food category to/from the menu.
Add a new/update/delete food item to/from the menu.
Update price for a given food item.
Update additional information (description, photo, etc.) for a given food item.

It is anticipated that the functionality provided by this component will be one of the first things noted by the restaurant user, as they will have to go through it to configure their menu, etc. before beginning to actually take orders. Once everything is initially configured, however, this component will likely be the least used, as menu updates generally do not occur with great frequency.

*Order Retrieval System
	Of the three components, the order retrieval system is functionally the simplest. Like the menu management system, it is designed to be used only by restaurant employees, and provides the following functions:
Retrieve new orders from the database.
Display the orders in an easily readable, graphical way.
Mark an order as having been processed and remove it from the list of active orders.
